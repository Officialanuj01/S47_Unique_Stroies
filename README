Unique StroiesðŸ˜Š 
Unique Stories is a website where any user can upload their stories. Other users can explore their stories. They can also like, and shareÂ theÂ stories.2.


The motivation behind building this website is to learn the concepts of the backend. I have learned Node.js, Express, and MongoDB in order to develop the website.\


#Upcoming Features:

User Login/ SignUp

Other security features allow only the author to delete the entity that is created by the user. Currently, anyone can delete any story.
